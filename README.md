Lab C and Mini 1 will provide some background help for this mini assignment.

QUESTION 1: A Project Setup Script

Software developers use scripting to support good software engineering practices. For this question we will explore a standard way that software developers organize their home directory when writing software.

Write a script called: mkproj ARGUMENT OWNER

Example: ./mkproj Ass2 jvybihal Where:

‚Ä¢ The script‚Äôs name is mkproj

‚Ä¢ ARGUMENT is the name of the software project the developer wants to initialize.

‚Ä¢ OWNER is the username of the person whom the project belongs to.

Use vi to create the script.

The script must do the following in the order presented:

1. Make sure the script is running in Bash

2. If the user did not provide the correct number of arguments, then display the following error message and then terminate the script: ‚ÄúError: Wrong number of arguments. Please type ./mkproj ARGUMENT OWNER. The argument is the name of the project. The OWNER is the user name the project belongs to.‚Äù

3. If the directory ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù does not exist, then the script creates that directory. If the directory already exists then nothing is done.

4. Change the working directory to Projects

5. If the directory ARGUMENT (i.e. the project name) already exists within the directory Projects, then terminate the script with the following error and change directory to the parent directory (where we came from): ‚ÄúError: The project name has already been used. Please select another project name and try again.‚Äù

6. Create the directory ARGUMENT (i.e. the project name).

7. Change the current directory to the directory ARGUMENT (i.e. the project name)

8. Create the subdirectories: archive, backup, docs, assets, database, source. Then use the ls command to display them as verification to the user.

9. Create a readme.txt file in the docs directory with the following default information: ‚ÄúCreated by:‚Äù and then insert the OWNER name. Display the file as verification to the user.

This script automates the creation of projects (each with its own directory name) within a directory called Projects. You can use this script for future assignments in this course as well as other courses.

mkproj ARGUMENT SUB OWNER

QUESTION 2: A Backup Script

Write a script called: backup SWITCH FILES DEST MESSAGE

Example: ./backup -D ~/source/*.c ~/backup Initial backup example Where:

‚Ä¢ SWITCH is optional: -D for delete original files. If not present the files to be backed-up are not deleted.

‚Ä¢ FILES is the path, using wild cards, of the files to be backed-up.

‚Ä¢ DEST is the path to the backup directory.

‚Ä¢ MESSAGE is a multiword description about the backup. It will be added to a log file.

Use vi to create the script.

The script must do the following in the order presented:

1. Make sure the script is running under Bash.

2. Verify that the script has the correct number of arguments. If it does not the script must terminate with the following error message: ‚ÄúYou have the incorrect number of arguments. The correct syntax is: ./backup SWITCH FILES DEST MESSAGE. Please try again.‚Äù

3. Verify that the DEST directory exists. If it does exist, then do nothing. If it does not exist, then create the directory.

5. CHMOD the tar file as RW for only the owner.

You must use mimi.cs.mcgill.ca to create the solutions to this assignment. You cannot use your Mac command-line, Windows command-line, nor a Linux distro installed locally on your laptop. You can ssh or putty from your laptop to mimi, or you can go to the third floor of Trottier and use any of those labs, to complete this assignment.

WHAT TO HAND IN

‚Ä¢ The bash script file: mkproj

‚Ä¢ The bash script file: backup

‚Ä¢ The above two files do not have a file extension.

‚Ä¢ Make sure to add comments to your script

‚Ä¢ Add you name and student ID number as a comment.

HOW IT WILL BE GRADED

GRADING RULES

‚Ä¢ A program must run in order to get a grade (even if it does not run well). If it does not run (does not compile) it will receive a zero. (Make sure to run your programs from mimi.cs.mcgill.ca).

‚Ä¢ All questions are graded proportionally. This means that if 40% of the question is correct, you will receive 40% of the grade.
